Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project features an interactive Emergency Room Performance Dashboard designed to monitor and analyze patient flow, operational efficiency, and clinical outcomes. The dashboard provides hospital administrators with real-time insights into wait times, patient satisfaction, and departmental workloads to improve overall healthcare delivery.

📊 Key Insights & Metrics
The dashboard provides a dynamic overview of ER performance, allowing users to filter data by Year (2023–2024) and Month to track the following critical KPIs:

Patient Throughput: Monitors the total volume of patients processed within the selected timeframe to identify peak periods and seasonal trends.

Wait Time Analysis: Calculates the Average Wait Time (in minutes), serving as a primary benchmark for operational efficiency and resource allocation.

Service Level (SLA): Visualizes the percentage of patients attended to On Time vs. Delayed, helping management identify bottlenecks in the triage process.

Patient Satisfaction Score: Aggregates feedback scores (on a scale of 1–10) to measure the quality of care and patient experience.

Clinical Outcomes (Admission Rate): Breaks down the ratio of patients who were Admitted to the hospital versus those Discharged (Not Admitted), providing insight into the severity of cases arriving at the ER.

Referral Patterns: Tracks patient distribution across specialized departments (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics, General Practice) to optimize specialist staffing.

Demographic Segmentation: Analyzes patient flow by Age Group and Gender to ensure the ER is equipped for the specific needs of the local population (e.g., pediatric vs. geriatric care)

📈 Visualizations Included
Patient Demographics: Breakdown by gender (near 50/50 split) and age groups (highest volume in the 0-9 and 20-29 ranges).

Operational Performance: A pie chart showing the ratio of "On Time" vs. "Delayed" patient attendance.

Departmental Referrals: Analysis of which departments (General Practice, Orthopedics, etc.) receive the most referrals from the ER.

Trend Analysis: Sparklines under the main KPIs show daily fluctuations in patient volume and wait times.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Visualization: [Excel]

Data Cleaning: [Power Query]

Data Source: Simulated Hospital ER Records (2023-2024).

🚀 How to Use
Filter by Date: Use the sidebar to toggle between months (January - December).

Yearly Comparison: Use the top toggle to switch between 2023 and 2024 data.

Cross-Filtering: Click on specific age groups or departments to see how they impact wait times and admission statuses.

📝 Key Findings
The "None" referral category is the largest, suggesting many patients visit the ER for non-specialized issues.

Wait time delays (62%) correlate with peak hours/months, suggesting a need for better staffing during high-volume periods.

The 0-9 age group represents one of the highest patient volumes, indicating a need for strong pediatric ER support.
