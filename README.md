Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project features an interactive Emergency Room Performance Dashboard designed to monitor and analyze patient flow, operational efficiency, and clinical outcomes. The dashboard provides hospital administrators with real-time insights into wait times, patient satisfaction, and departmental workloads to improve overall healthcare delivery.

📊 Key Insights & Metrics
The dashboard tracks several critical KPIs for the month of May 2024:

Total Patients: 519 patients processed.

Average Wait Time: 35.81 minutes (Targeting a reduction in wait times).

Patient Satisfaction: 5.15/10 (Identifying areas for service improvement).

Service Efficiency: Only 38% of patients were attended to on time, while 62% experienced delays.

Admission Rate: 51% of patients were admitted to the hospital, while 49% were discharged after ER treatment.

📈 Visualizations Included
Patient Demographics: Breakdown by gender (near 50/50 split) and age groups (highest volume in the 0-9 and 20-29 ranges).

Operational Performance: A pie chart showing the ratio of "On Time" vs. "Delayed" patient attendance.

Departmental Referrals: Analysis of which departments (General Practice, Orthopedics, etc.) receive the most referrals from the ER.

Trend Analysis: Sparklines under the main KPIs show daily fluctuations in patient volume and wait times.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Visualization: [e.g., Power BI / Tableau / Excel]

Data Cleaning: [e.g., Power Query / Python / SQL]

Data Source: Simulated Hospital ER Records (2023-2024).

🚀 How to Use
Filter by Date: Use the sidebar to toggle between months (January - December).

Yearly Comparison: Use the top toggle to switch between 2023 and 2024 data.

Cross-Filtering: Click on specific age groups or departments to see how they impact wait times and admission statuses.

📝 Key Findings
The "None" referral category is the largest, suggesting many patients visit the ER for non-specialized issues.

Wait time delays (62%) correlate with peak hours/months, suggesting a need for better staffing during high-volume periods.

The 0-9 age group represents one of the highest patient volumes, indicating a need for strong pediatric ER support.
